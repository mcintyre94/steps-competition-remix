- Install supabase
- npm install @supabase/supabase-js
- create supabase client: `export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey, {fetch: fetch.bind(globalThis)})`
  - custom fetch impl because cloudflare workers don't have XMLHttpRequest
- Update root:
  - Action: get session + create/delete cookie based on supabase event
  - useEffect: listen to supabase auth change + call action
- On a page:
  - Loader: get session + authed user (if any) on load
  - Action: supabase sign-in (send magic link)
  - On the page: transition shows sending message, action shows sent message (or error)
